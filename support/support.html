          <h2>About the Cause</h2>
            <p id= "about" class="border standard">Oakland youth need productive outlets for self-expression, discovery, and exploration of their interests outside of school. "Do it for the BayKids" aims to bring just that for the community regardless of income, ability, or location. With after-school, weekend, and summer programming, youth are able to come together and build healthy relationships, self-sufficiency, skill-build, and productively become involved in the community. Proceeds of the event will benefit extracurricular programming for all and foster a healthy supportive environment for youth. To help children and their families, we will also be connecting guests with resources to support with other life necessities. Let's do it together and join us at the BayKids festival event this summer!</p>
