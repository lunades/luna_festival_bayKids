# Do it for the BayKids
Responsive Web Design and branding project by Elise Luna

## About 
This project was created to advocate for expanding accessible youth programming for low-income communities in the Bay Area. As a part of the "Wraparound Initiative" which emphasizes the importance of fostering supportive, positive, healthy environments for children's development, this festival will raise funds for extracurricular programming. Furthermore, initiatives to support the overall well-being of children and families will be present to provide resources for basic necessities. 

Highlighting "Oakland-Grown" celebrities who will be the main attraction brings a broad range of support to the event. These headliners are known for their support of extracurricular involvement whether in the arts, sports, theater, and music. Open to all, proceeds of ticket sales and merchandise will go to youth organizations across the Bay.

Further, the event will take place over the second weekend of June while children across the Bay are home from school looking for things to do. This weekend date also highlight National Children's Day to bring heightened awareness to the cause. Integrated interactive activities for guests will bring excitement so they will be more of participants rather than simply an audience-member.

## Overview
Appealing to the general public but targetted toward low-income families, I wanted the theme of this site to be light and fun. Having pastels and an easy to view logo/branding brings this to fruition. As the proceeds go toward youth programming, much of the animated visuals present appeal to not only a younger demographic, but also to adolescents and adults as well. Overall bringing a broad audience to raise funding at a central location of the Bay Area known for it's lively events- the Oracle Colliseum in Oakland, CA.

Merging design principles,  HTML/CSS technical skill, and understanding of Youth Development, this vibrant website demonstrates the notion of storytelling with purpose, as I utilize various branding elements to bring the event to life for the cause. Through this project, I embraced the role of an informed designer, leveraging my skills to amplify the voice of a cause greater than myself.

## Supporting Materials
This capstone project required extensive planning to reach optimal execution. Research about the topic was through my overall learning experience in my undergraduate degree in Child and Adolescent Development. Further, the concept development and design aspects required documentation as you may find below:
