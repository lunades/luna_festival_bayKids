Responsive Web Design project by Elise Luna

## About 
This project represents a culmination of my semester-long learning in the class “Intro to Web Design” along with the nuanced knowledge I’ve gained in my undergraduate degree in Child and Adolescent Development. Merging design principles,  HTML/CSS technical skill, and understanding of Youth Development, I aim to craft a vibrant website for a fictional festival happening in celebration of National Children’s Day on the second weekend of June. The event is centered around the wraparound initiative which is focused on creating supportive environments for youth. To raise funding for accessible extracurricular programming and basic resource, the event revenue will go toward youth organizations in Oakland. This endeavor was about storytelling with purpose, as I utilize various branding elements to bring the event to life for the cause. Through this project, I embraced the role of an informed designer, leveraging my skills to amplify the voice of a cause greater than myself.

## Overview
The "Do it for the BayKids" festival will be raising funding for children's extracurriculars for the youth to have access to a positive and supportive environment outside of school that is free or low-cost. Appealing to the general public but targetted toward low-income families, I wanted the theme to be light and fun. Having pastels and an easy to view logo/branding brings this to fruition. Further, I want to have lots of illustrations/characters so it feels artistic (raising funds for the arts etc).

The event will facilitate activities for guests, feature "Oakland-grown" artists and performances, and will also have resources that support the overall well-being of youth. This includes services and organizations that offer support in getting basic necessities for themselves and their families such as food, housing, transportation, and healthcare (physical and mental). Overall, raising awareness and funding for the cause and expanding accessibility to programming and services.


## Supporting Materials
This capstone project required extensive planning to reach optimal execution. Research about the topic was through my overall learning experience in my undergraduate degree in Child and Adolescent Development. Further, the concept development and design aspects required documentation as you may find below:
